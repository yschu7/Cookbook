## Ingredients

4 Servings

2
Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil

4
oz. thinly sliced guanciale, pancetta, or chopped unsmoked bacon

½
tsp. crushed red pepper flakes

½
tsp. freshly ground black pepper

¾
cup minced onion

2
cloves garlic, minced

1
28-oz. can peeled tomatoes with juices, crushed by hand

Kosher salt

12
oz. dried bucatini or spaghetti

¼
cup finely grated Pecorino (about 1 oz.)

## Preparation

### Step 1
Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add guanciale and sauté until crisp and golden, about 4 minutes. Add pepper flakes and black pepper; stir for 10 seconds. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until soft, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 15-20 minutes.

### Step 2
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt; add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until 2 minutes before al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta cooking water.

### Step 3
Add drained pasta to sauce in skillet and toss vigorously with tongs to coat. Add 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water and cook until sauce coats pasta and pasta is al dente, about 2 minutes. (Add a little pasta water if sauce is too dry.) Stir in cheese and transfer pasta to warmed bowls.
